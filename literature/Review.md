# Literature Review for preparatory work
## Cortical microcircuits as gated-recurrent neural networks
In this paper the author aim to design a type of biologically inspired network, subLSTM. It modified the gating mechanism, changing it from
multiplying to subtrative. It is inspired by cortical microcircuits, where the inhibitory and exhibitory cells displays a similar mechanism if we're approximating at a firing rate level.

"SubLSTM units are a mapping of LSTMs onto known canonical excitatory-inhibitory cortical microcircuits"
Each unit in LSTM has a memory cell $c_t$, input, forget and output gates $i_t$, $f_t$ and $i_t$. 

## Synaptic Theory of Working Memory

### Terminology
Working memory: enables the temporary holding of information for processing purposes, playing a crucial role in the execution of a wide range of cognitive tasks


### Summary
The previous studies often consider working memory to be represented by intrinsic cell properties or spiking activity. However, this is energy inefficient and show mismatch in some of the results. Therefore, this article propose that WM may be sustained by the calcium-mediated synaptic facilitation in the recurrent connections of neocortical networks.
